#Example:
We have chosen ten of the most famous speeches in English. They range from celebrated, world-changing pieces of rhetoric to our personal favourites, but most importantly they still rouse our emotions when we hear them today. We have examined each for the tricks of the oratory trade. After each speech youâ€™ll find some bullet points outlining its most distinctive rhetorical features, and why a speech writer would include them.

```bash
$ lang_frequency.py example.txt
The most frequent word in example.txt:
('we', 3)
('most', 3)
('of', 3)
('the', 3)
('them', 2)
```
